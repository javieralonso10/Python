# Python Learning & Projects

Welcome — this repository is a personal learning workspace for practicing Python and building small projects that demonstrate core competencies.

Goals
-	Learn Python fundamentals and best practices.
-	Build multiple small, focused projects to apply concepts.
-	Create clear, documented examples you can show to others.

How to use this repo
-	Keep each project or exercise in its own folder with a short README explaining what it demonstrates.
-	Name folders with a clear prefix like `exercise-` or `project-`.

Suggested project ideas
-	CLI utilities: a todo manager, file organizer, or text analyzer.
-	Data scripts: CSV/JSON processing or simple scraping + reporting.
-	Web micro-app: a tiny Flask/FastAPI app demonstrating routing and forms.
-	Automation: small scripts to automate repetitive tasks (image resize, batch rename).

Repository structure (recommended)
-	`/exercise-01/` — small focused exercises
-	`/project-01/` — slightly larger projects with README and run instructions
-	`requirements.txt` — optional per-project virtual env dependencies

Getting started
1.	Clone the repo.
2.	Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3.	Install dependencies for a project when needed, for example:

```bash
pip install -r project-01/requirements.txt
```

Best practices
-	Keep functions small and well-named.
-	Write a short README for every project and include usage examples.
-	Add simple tests where useful.
